# Custom LoL Leaderboard
This program visualizes the leaderboard [League of Legends](https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-gb/). The program consists of all players which are in Master, Grandmaster or Challenger (Solo/Duo or Flex). Furthermore, the tool is capable of showing which players will promote to Grandmaster/Challenger or demote to Grandmaster/Master. Also, the tool shows the current LP which has to be exceeded to reach Grandmaster/Challenger.
